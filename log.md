- In my button.navbar-toggler element, I had:

 data-toggle="collapse"

- A bit of a tough time putting code hours in yesterday, but I did it anyway.  

## Day 3: July 3, 2020  

- Spent hours trying to get a bootstrap4 toggle button to open nav after it collapsed. 
- The discussion forums for the class had a few people saying that jQuery 3.5.0 broke bootstrap navbar toggler button component. 
- Reinstalled later and earlier versions but error persisted.

- I spent too much time believing it must be a version problem. 
- Spoiler: it wasn't.
- Do not believe everything you read on the internet.

- Should have returned to basic debugging steps sooner

**Today's Progress**: 

- Working on week one of Coursera Front-End Web UI Frameworks and Tools: Bootstrap4 course. 
- Created the beginning of a book site, Amazon meets O'Reilly. 

**Thoughts:** 

- I put in at least 5 hours. Lots of set up and planning. A good solid 2 hours or more coding html and bootstrap. Good day. 

**Most Amazing:** 

- I have read www.example.com at least a hundred time. 
- I never knew there was a real site connected to it!
