# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 4: July 4, 2020

**Toady's Progress**:

- Fixed bug in my bootstrap code. 
- In my button.navbar-toggler element, I had:
``` 
  data-toggler="collapse" 
```
- instead of:
```
 data-toggle="collapse" 
```
- It mattered. One little letter made the difference. It happens, a lot.

**Thoughts**

A bit of a tough time putting code hours in yesterday, but I did it anyway.


## Day 3: July 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 

- Spent hours trying to get a bootstrap4 toggle button to open nav after it collapsed. 
- The discussion forums for the class had a few people saying that jQuery 3.5.0 broke bootstrap navbar toggler button component. 
- Reinstalled later and earlier versions but error persisted.

- I spent too much time believing it must be a version problem. 
- Spoiler: it wasn't.
- Do not believe everything you read on the internet.

**Thoughts**

- Should have returned to basic debugging steps sooner
## Day 2: July 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 

- I completed Week 1 of Coursera's Front-end Web UI Frameworks & Tools: Bootstrap4

**Thoughts**: 

- Partial List of classes so far: 
  - container 
  - row 
  - col-*-n, col-12, col-sm-6 
  - jumbotron 
  - d-none
  - order-first, order-last 


## Day 1: July 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 

- Working on week one of Coursera Front-End Web UI Frameworks and Tools: Bootstrap4 course. 
- Created the beginning of a book site, Amazon meets O'Reilly. 

**Thoughts:** 

- I put in at least 5 hours. Lots of set up and planning. A good solid 2 hours or more coding html and bootstrap. Good day. 

**Most Amazing:** 

- I have read www.example.com at least a hundred time. 
- I never knew there was a real site connected to it!
