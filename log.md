- Productive good day

## Day 6: July 6, 2020  
- Spent most of the time 'committing' more git commands to memory.
- Practiced the same 4 or 5 commands I use and added new ones.

## Day 5: July 5, 2020  
- Worked on Week 2 of the coursera bootstrap course.  
- I've wanted to try bootstrap but I'm anxious to get through this course.  
- I went down a rabbit hole with new git commands.  
- And then into another rabbit hole looking at javascript code in the node_modules. Oh my!

## Day 4: July 4, 2020  
- Fixed bug in my bootstrap code. 
- In my button.navbar-toggler element, I had:
``` 
  data-toggler="collapse" 
```
- instead of:
```
 data-toggle="collapse" 
```
- It mattered. One little letter made the difference. It happens, a lot.  

- A bit of a tough time putting code hours in yesterday, but I did it anyway.  

## Day 3: July 3, 2020  

- Spent hours trying to get a bootstrap4 toggle button to open nav after it collapsed. 
- The discussion forums for the class had a few people saying that jQuery 3.5.0 broke bootstrap navbar toggler button component. 
- Reinstalled later and earlier versions but error persisted.

- I spent too much time believing it must be a version problem. 
- Spoiler: it wasn't.
- Do not believe everything you read on the internet.

- Should have returned to basic debugging steps sooner
## Day 2: July 2, 2020

- I completed Week 1 of Coursera's Front-end Web UI Frameworks & Tools: Bootstrap4

## Day 1: July 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 

- Working on week one of Coursera Front-End Web UI Frameworks and Tools: Bootstrap4 course. 
- Created the beginning of a book site, Amazon meets O'Reilly. 

**Thoughts:** 

- I put in at least 5 hours. Lots of set up and planning. A good solid 2 hours or more coding html and bootstrap. Good day. 

**Most Amazing:** 

- I have read www.example.com at least a hundred time. 
- I never knew there was a real site connected to it!
